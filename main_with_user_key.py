As you  know, she is a 73-year-old woman who initially had a right breast mass  removed in February 1994 with an axillary lymph node dissection.  That  surgical procedure revealed a 1 cm, grade 1, infiltrating ductal  carcinoma with clear surgical margins and 21 axillary lymph nodes were  negative for metastatic carcinoma.  S-phase was low at 3.6%.  The tumor  was found to be estrogen-receptor positive and progesterone-receptor  negative.  She received interstitial radiation, which comprised 4500  centigray over a 3 cm diameter.  She received tamoxifen from 1994 to  1996 and stopped due to concern regarding side effects.  At that time,  she was seeing Dr. ***** *****.  In January 1996, a node was  palpated in the left supraclavicular area.  A fine-needle aspiration was  performed and was unremarkable.  A dense area at the 12 o'clock position  in her right breast was tender in 2006 and was felt to be postsurgical  scarring.  This was noted to increase over time in size and density.  Initially, the workup included a PET scan in November 2005
#  that  revealed a 5 x 7 cm area of density consistent with inflammation.  It is  not clear whether she had a CT-guided biopsy at that time or not.  In  February 2008, she noted discomfort in the right anterior chest wall and  again thought that this area might be slightly larger.  She also thought  that she had a new right breast mass.  Workup of that breast mass was  unremarkable.  However, a breast MRI was performed on March 24 that  revealed a bulky irregular mass in the right 8 o'clock posterior breast,  which measured 1.9 x 1.5 cm with heterogenous enhancement.  Concordant  with an area of metabolic uptake on PET/CT scan, there was a second mass  abutting the pectoralis muscle with similar enhancing characteristics  measuring 1.7 x 1.2 cm.  A third nodule was seen along the right lateral  breast measuring 0.6 x 0.3 cm.  The left breast was unremarkable.  The  PET/CT scan had been performed on 02/22/2008, and was compared to a  PET/CT scan in December 2005.  This revealed a 2 cm right axillary  lymph node and a 1.4 cm hypermetabolic soft tissue nodule with an SUV of  4.1 in the right mid anterior chest wall deep in the subcutaneous fat.  A second right axillary lymph node was also noted, which was  hypermetabolic.  Subsequently, Dr. ***** performed a fine-needle  aspiration of the upper medial area, which was positive for carcinoma,  and a core biopsy of the right breast mass, which revealed a reactive  lymph node.

History of Present Illness 
Glioblastoma: WHO grade IV, IDH wild-type by IHC, ATRX preserved, p53 scattered, Ki67 focally up to 
20%, MGMT pending 
Oncomine: PTEN, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion, EGFR amplification 
Foundation not done 
71-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with right frontal GBM (IDH wild-type, MGMT not yet resulted) s/p 
resection by Dr. Schwartz on 12/18/19, s/p RT/TMZ (40 Gy in 15 fractions, 1/15/20-2/5/20) presenting for 
follow-up. 
Regarding her neuro-oncologic history, patient was had general memory loss for approximately 1 year 
attributed to aging. In the month prior to presentation, memory impairment dramatically worsened to the 
point that patient was unable to find her way home after leaving the house. She was also noted to be more 
somnolent, falling asleep frequently including during meals. She saw an outside neurologist who 
performed an MRI brain which revealed a left frontal mass lesion with surrounding edema. He was 
admitted to WCMC on 12/13/19. MRI brain with and without contrast performed 12/14/19 revealed an 
enhancing right frontal mass crossing the corpus callosum with surrounding vasogenic edema as well as 
non-enhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the right precentral gyrus, left frontal region, and right 
thalamus. She underwent right frontal craniotomy and resection of the right frontal mass on 12/18/19 by 
Dr. Schwartz; pathology revealed GBM (IDH wild-type by IHC, MGMT promoter methylation status 
pending). Post-operatively, she required insulin intermittently for steroid-induced hyperglycemia. PT/OT 
recommended discharge to SAR, but family requested that patient be discharged home with 24-hour 
supervision. 
Patient underwent hypofractionated course of RT/TMZ (40 Gy in 15 fractions) from 1/15/20-2/5/20 with Dr. 
Knisely. The decision was made not to pursue Foundation Medicine testing on tumor tissue given patient's 
advanced age, neurologic deficits, and frailty. Daughter reported that patient had difficulty standing from a 
seated position with moon facies on 1/31/20; she was instructed to stop dexamethasone. However, at 
Radiation Oncology appointment on 2/5/20, she was still taking dexamethasone 1 mg daily; she was 
instructed to take 1 mg qod for 1 week then stop dexamethasone. 
Today, patient presents with her daughter for follow-up. Daughter states that patient had fever and cough 
1-2 weeks ago and that she went to her family doctor; symptoms are now improved. She has had no 
recent travel outside the country nor contact with anyone who has traveled outside the country recently. 
Daughter feels that patient's legs are weaker and that she has had hair loss following RT. She is no longer 
taking dexamethasone; her face and legs were swollen on dexamethasone, but swelling has now improved. Patient reports pain in her left leg. Cognitively, daughter feels that patient's memory/thicking are 
possibly slightly worse; when she wakes up, she is more confused, but confusion improves throughout the 
day. She used to be able to write her name but now is unable to do so. 
Assessment & Plan 
71-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with right frontal GBM (IDH wild-type, MGMT not yet resulted) s/p 
resection by Dr. Schwartz on 12/18/19, s/p RT/TMZ (40 Gy in 15 fractions, 1/15/20-2/5/20) presenting for 
follow-up. Neurologic exam at this time remains notable for disorientation to time, difficulty following 
complex commands, and marked bradyphrenia with psychomotor slowing as well as shuffling gait 
necessitating a rolling walker. MRI brain performed today approximately 1 month after the completion of 
RT reveals new nodular enhancement in the left frontal lobe distant from the initial resection cavity as well 
as new nodular enhancement along the margins of the resection site extending along the right lateral 
ventricle and involving the corpus callosum concerning for progression of disease. At this time, given the 
rapidity of her disease progression, and given her frailty and significant cognitive/functional impairment, 
further treatment carries a significant risk of adversely affecting her quality of life while offering little benefit. 
We discussed that she has multifocal disease which is not amenable to surgery or further RT, and that 
there are chemotherapies that can be trialed, but that these treatments are unlikely to be significantly
effective or improve her quality of life while posing a substantial risk of side effects given her neurologic 
deficits and frailty. Given that the risks of further treatment outweigh any potential benefit, would 
recommend focusing care on comfort and pursuing home hospice. We discussed that, at some point, her 
tumor would grow further and end her life; we discussed that hospice services could help treat any 
symptoms she may have and help maintain her comfort and quality of life. Patient's daughter expressed 
understanding and stated that, rather than having our office make referrals to hospice now, she would like 
to set up hospice through the patient's family doctor. We encouraged patient's daughter to call us, as we 
are happy to assist in any way possible. 
Plan: 
1) Right frontal/multifocal GBM: rapid progression of disease 
-Recommend pursuing hospice at this time as above. Daughter would like to set up hospice through 
patient's family doctor and will call if they require any assistance 
-No further MRls 
2) Steroids: Off steroids as of 2/2020, no indication to re-start 
3) AEDs: No history of seizures. 
-Continue Keppra 500mg bid for seizure prevention 
4) Cognitive impairment, frailty: Recommend home hospice as above

# _plc = " I had the pleasure of seeing this patient in consultation regarding the  treatment of her locally recurrent breast cancer on January 09.  As you  know, she is a 73-year-old woman who initially had a right breast mass  removed in February 1994 with an axillary lymph node dissection.  That  surgical procedure revealed a 1 cm, grade 1, infiltrating ductal  carcinoma with clear surgical margins and 21 axillary lymph nodes were  negative for metastatic carcinoma.  S-phase was low at 3.6%.  The tumor  was found to be estrogen-receptor positive and progesterone-receptor  negative.  She received interstitial radiation, which comprised 4500  centigray over a 3 cm diameter.  She received tamoxifen from 1994 to  1996 and stopped due to concern regarding side effects.  At that time,  she was seeing Dr. ***** *****.  In January 1996, a node was  palpated in the left supraclavicular area.  A fine-needle aspiration was  performed and was unremarkable.  A dense area at the 12 o'clock position  in her right breast was tender in 2006 and was felt to be postsurgical  scarring.  This was noted to increase over time in size and density.  Initially, the workup included a PET scan in November 2005  that  revealed a 5 x 7 cm area of density consistent with inflammation.  It is  not clear whether she had a CT-guided biopsy at that time or not.  In  February 2008, she noted discomfort in the right anterior chest wall and  again thought that this area might be slightly larger.  She also thought  that she had a new right breast mass.  Workup of that breast mass was  unremarkable.  However, a breast MRI was performed on March 24 that  revealed a bulky irregular mass in the right 8 o'clock posterior breast,  which measured 1.9 x 1.5 cm with heterogenous enhancement.  Concordant  with an area of metabolic uptake on PET/CT scan, there was a second mass  abutting the pectoralis muscle with similar enhancing characteristics  measuring 1.7 x 1.2 cm.  A third nodule was seen along the right lateral  breast measuring 0.6 x 0.3 cm.  The left breast was unremarkable.  The  PET/CT scan had been performed on 02/22/2008, and was compared to a  PET/CT scan in December 2005.  This revealed a 2 cm right axillary  lymph node and a 1.4 cm hypermetabolic soft tissue nodule with an SUV of  4.1 in the right mid anterior chest wall deep in the subcutaneous fat.  A second right axillary lymph node was also noted, which was  hypermetabolic.  Subsequently, Dr. ***** performed a fine-needle  aspiration of the upper medial area, which was positive for carcinoma,  and a core biopsy of the right breast mass, which revealed a reactive  lymph node.
